Upon dismounting, Kled dashes toward his nexus, though not through terrain, cleanses himself of all crowd control and becomes unable to act, untargetable, and immune to crowd control for 0.5 seconds, during which he also reduces all incoming damage received by 100%.<br>While Kled is Dismounted, his base health and base movement speed are reduced, his base attack range is increased, Bear Trap on a Rope is replaced with Pocket Pistol, and Jousting and Chaaaaaaaarge!!! become unusable.<br>Innate: Kled is only vulnerable to death while Dismounted. Kled has [[5]], which is not improved by sources of bonus health, as well as reduced base movement speed and increased attack range. Percent-health effects consider Kled & Skaarl's combined maximum health, meaning that a Dismounted Kled is always considered to be low health.<br>Kled gains [[7]] when moving towards visible enemy champions within 1000 units, but his basic attacks against them are reduced to [[0]]. Additionally, he gains the ability to restore Skaarl's Courage to reunite again.<br>Innate - Courage: Kled gains 15 Courage when basic attacking an enemy champion, 20 Courage whenever he scores a takedown against an enemy champion within 3 seconds of damaging them, 4 Courage for minion kills, and 5 Courage when basic attacking a structure or epic monster.

Mounting up resets the cooldowns of Bear Trap on a Rope and Jousting.<br>While at the allied fountain, 25 Courage is generated every 0.25 seconds. Recalling fully restores Skaarl's Courage and health. If reuniting outside of base, Skaarl gets Frayed Nerves, which prevents him from gaining Courage for 30 seconds.<br>The current status of Kled's own health is preserved between subsequent dismounts.
